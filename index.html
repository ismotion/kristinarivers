    <h1>Kristina's Record Ride</h1>
    <p>
      This April, 2023 it’s time to chase down that Guinness World Record for fastest women to cross Australia by bike. It’s been a busy six months since the last attempt, with work, family, a new puppy addition and squeezing in 10,000km of riding. I’m stronger, better supported, and the whole team wiser. 

Ready. 
    </p>

    <h2>Ready.</h2>
    <p>
      Plan is to leave from Manly on Sunday, April 2nd at 5am and arrive in Perth 12 days later having ridden 3,940km - that’s about 360 km a day or for me at least 16 hours a day. 

    </p>
    <h3>Why chase a world record when life is busy enough?</h3>
      
    <p>
      Because I believe if we're not pushing ourselves beyond our known limits we're not finding out what we're truly capable of. I want to inspire my daughters, and you, to step out and try hard things – I believe that anything is possible.
    </p>
    <h3>What has changed since the last attempt and why will this one be successful? 
</h3>
    <p>
      I’m twice as strong as I was at the beginning of the last attempt. And healthy. I feel confident and capable and my mindset is focused on the journey rather than the outcome. </p>
    <p>The weather looks like we’ll be starting with easterly winds and generally looks to be milder weather with most of the heat behind us. </p>
    <p>I have more support. This time a physiotherapist I trust a phone call away and the best sports therapist on hand with us. We’ll likely have two vehicles with one being a motherhome meaning more comfort and no freezing showers in the open cold air of the outback! </p>
    <p>These efforts are truly a team effort and I’ve surrounded myself with the best of the best and together we are unstoppable. </p>
