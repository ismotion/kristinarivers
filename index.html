    <h1>Kristina Rivers</h1>
    <p>
      This April, 2023 it’s time to chase down that Guinness World Record for fastest women to cross Australia by bike. It’s been a busy six months since the last attempt, with work, family, a new puppy addition and squeezing in 10,000km of riding. I’m stronger, better supported, and the whole team wiser. 

Ready.

    <h2>Ready</h2>
    <p>
      Plan is to leave from Manly on Sunday, April 2nd at 5am and arrive in Perth 12 days later having ridden 3,940km - that’s about 360 km a day or for me at least 16 hours a day. 

    </p>
    <h3>Why chase a world record when life is busy enough?</h3>
      
    <p>
      Because I believe if we're not pushing ourselves beyond our known limits we're not finding out what we're truly capable of. I want to inspire my daughters, and you, to step out and try hard things – I believe that anything is possible.
    </p>
    <h3>What has changed since the last attempt and why will this one be successful? 
</h3>
    <p>
      I’m twice as strong as I was at the beginning of the last attempt. And healthy. I feel confident and capable and my mindset is focused on the journey rather than the outcome. 

The weather looks like we’ll be starting with easterly winds and generally looks to be milder weather with most of the heat behind us. 

I have more support. This time a physiotherapist I trust a phone call away and the best sports therapist on hand with us. We’ll likely have two vehicles with one being a motherhome meaning more comfort and no freezing showers in the open cold air of the outback! 

These efforts are truly a team effort and I’ve surrounded myself with the best of the best and together we are unstoppable. 

    </p>
